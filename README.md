## [RKR_potential_CO_Xstate](https://github.com/ksonod/scientific_works/tree/master/RKR_potential_CO_Xstate)
1. <strong>Description</strong>: The potential energy curve of CO in the X state is calculated using Rydberg-Klein-Rees method. In order to avoid singular points in integrals, Watson's method is used. The integrals are numerically calculated using Simpson's method. The calculated potential energy curve can be used for various applications, e.g., evaluation of optical transition probability based on Franck-Condon factors.  
2. <strong>Programming language</strong>: C
3. <strong>Technical keywords</strong>: numerical integration, avoiding singular points in integral, creating text files
4. <strong>Scientific keywords</strong>: RKR potential, Watson's method

## [BBO_Crystal](https://github.com/ksonod/scientific_works/tree/master/BBO_Crystal)
1. <strong>Description</strong>: The phase-matching angle for the sum-frequency generation (SFG) or second harmonic generation (SHG) is calculated for a beta-barium borate (BBO) crystal (type I). The dependence of the refractive indices on the wavelength is also obtained. These calculations are needed when designing optical setups.  
2. <strong>Programming language</strong>: Matlab
3. <strong>Technical keywords</strong>: interactive command line
4. <strong>Scientific keywords</strong>: BBO crystal, phase-matching angle, refractive indices, Sellmeier's equation

## [analyze_spectroscpic_data](https://github.com/ksonod/scientific_works/tree/master/analyze_spectroscopic_data)
1. <strong>Description</strong>: The soft-X ray energy in absorption spectra of sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) is calibrated using regression analysis. The observed peaks are fitted with Voigt function whose Lorentzian component is taken from literature and fixed. With this fitting method, the energy resolution of a spectrometer is evaluated using the determined Gaussian component of the Voigt function.
2. <strong>Programing Language</strong>: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
3. <strong>Technical keywords</strong>: regression analysis, fitting data with Voigt function, data visualization based on Matplotlib and Plotly
4. <strong>Scientific keywords</strong>: soft-X ray absorption spectroscopy, energy calibration, peak analysis, spectral resolution
