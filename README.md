- Description
The potential energy curve of CO in the X state is calculated using Rydberg-Klein-Rees method. In order to avoid singular points in integrals, Watson's method is used. The integrals are numerically calculated using Simpson's method. The calculated potential energy curve can be used for various applications, e.g., evaluation of optical transition probability based on Franck-Condon factors.
