# About this repository
In this repository, the temporal profile of femtosecond laser pulses, i.e., pulse width and temporal chirp parameter, is retrieved by analyzing traces of polarization-gated [frequency-resolved optical gating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-resolved_optical_gating) (PG-FROG) using a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). The model can quickly characterize laser pulses once training process is finished.  
  
Main files in this repository are:
- FROG.ipynb: Numerical simulation tool for polarization-gate version of frequency-resolved optical gating (PG-FROG). After running this notebook, training images, i.e., PG-FROG traces, will be created. 
- CNN.ipynb: Regression analysis using a convolutional neural network.
- frog_func.py: Some functions needed for numerical simulation 
- frog_train.zip: Sample images generated by FROG.ipynb.        
  
If you want to prepare your own training images, you should start with FROG.ipynb. If you want to train a convolutional neural network using training images generated by FROG.ipynb or stored in frog_train.zip, you can check CNN.ipynb.

# About FROG
### Theoretical background
#### Introduction
Basic theoretical background can be found in the following materials
- Electric field and temporal phases: reference [1], page 21-23
- Theoretical background, actual FROG traces, and experimental conditions: reference [1] page 118-122  

#### Temporal and spectral profile
In the present study, a laser pulse with a Gaussian profile and quadratic temporal phase is considered:
$$
    E(t) = E_0exp(-at^2)exp(ibt^2).
$$
Here, E<sub>0</sub> is the amplitude (constant), a is the parameter that determines the pulse width, and b is the chirp parameter. In this case, the temporal phase is simply
$$
    \phi(t) = -bt^2.
$$
The Fourier transform of this field is 
$$
    \tilde{E}(\omega)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{a-ib}exp\biggl(-\frac{\omega^2}{4(a-ib)}\biggr)
$$

#### FROG
In order to get a FROG trace, an autocorrelation signal based on nonlinear optical effect is resolved in terms of frequency. The PG-FROG trace is 
$$
    I_{PG-FROG}(\omega , \tau)=\biggl|\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}E(t)|E(t-\tau)|^2exp(-i\omega t)dt\biggr|^2,
$$
where &omega; is the angular frequency, t is the time, E(t) is the complex pulse field versus time, and &tau; is the delay between the two replicas of the pulse. The integral part is basically the Fourier transformation of E(t)|E(t-&tau;)|<sup>2</sup>.
