# About this repository
In this repository, the temporal profile of femtosecond laser pulses, i.e., pulse width and temporal chirp parameter, is retrieved by analyzing traces of polarization-gated [frequency-resolved optical gating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-resolved_optical_gating) (PG-FROG) using a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). The model can quickly characterize laser pulses once training process is finished.

- [frog_func.py](https://github.com/ksonod/scientific_works/blob/master/convnet_for_pg-frog/frog_func.py): Some functions needed for numerical simulation 
- frog_train.zip: Sample images generated by FROG.ipynb.        
  
If you want to prepare your own training images, you should start with FROG.ipynb. If you want to train a convolutional neural network using training images generated by FROG.ipynb or stored in frog_train.zip, you can check CNN.ipynb.

# Theoretical background of FROG
## Theory
Basic theoretical background can be found in the following materials:
- Electric field and temporal phases: reference [1], page 21-23
- Theoretical background, actual FROG traces, and experimental conditions: reference [1] page 118-122   
- My notebook [FROG.ipynb](https://github.com/ksonod/scientific_works/blob/master/convnet_for_pg-frog/FROG.ipynb) 
   
In the present study, a laser pulse with a Gaussian profile and quadratic temporal phase is considered:

Here, E<sub>0</sub> is the amplitude, a is the parameter that determines the temporal width of a laser pulse, and b is the chirp parameter. In this case, the temporal phase is simply given by
