# analyze_spectroscopic_data

## Objectives
In the enclosed notebook, a soft X-ray absorption spectrum of sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) is analyzed. The main objectives are:
- To calibrate the photon energy of soft X-ray.
- To evaluate the energy resolution of a spectrometer.

## Methods
- Regression analysis for calibrating the photon energy of soft X-ray.
- Fitting peaks with Voigt function. 
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Plotly.

The method used in the notebook can be applied to various spectra in different photon energy region (e.g., IR, UV-vis).
